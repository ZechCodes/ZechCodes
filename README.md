I am a lifelong programmer with a passion for helping others grow & build amazing things. An avid Pythonista, I have worked professionally building bespoke websites & plugins using PHP, JavaScript, & SQL. I love talking about & creating simple to use interfaces to powerful service-oriented systems using technologies including WebSockets, gRPC, & containerization.
            
I currently run the [Beginner.Codes Discord](https://beginner.codes). A friendly community of more than 8,000 members helping each other become better programmers everyday.

I also stream live-coding sessions, semi-regulary, on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6-iUsH8cOQ2GxGLyIVcw-Q). I've mostly been streaming Python coding sessions building web backends, but recently I've also begun learning Go on stream. If you wanna drop by I'm live most Wednesdays at 5pm EST and Sundays at 3pm EST.

## My Current Projects

### Bevy

[Bevy](https://github.com/ZechCodes/Bevy) is a dependency inversion framework for Python. It's mostly class based, a necessity for tracking the existing dependencies, but doesn't require you to have any understanding of OOP. It provides powerful control over how instances are created when doing injection using a provider system. This allows dependencies to be initialized with values from the environment, config files, etc.

### Beginner.Codes

The [Beginner.Codes Organization](https://github.com/beginner-codes) has a bunch of projects necessary to the operation of the Discord community. We've got websites, Discord bots, etc. that have been written by me and the members of the community.

### Wordlette (Work in Progress)

[Wordlette](https://github.com/ZechCodes/wordlette) is a CMS built on [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) using Bevy for dependency management. The goal is for it to be an opinionated & extensible framework that is entirely usable out of the box with zero coding necessary.

### Schism (Work in Progress)

[Schism](https://github.com/ZechCodes/schism) is a microservice framework that uses Bevy to separate services out from a shared codebase. It will allow a monolithic application to be split it into separate stand alone applications that communicate over the network. Unfortunately it cannot magically break every monolith into microservices, each application will have to be written in a service-oriented way. Its purpose is to simplify bridging between services inside of the application without requiring the services to know anything about the bridge being used.
