Hey there! I've had a lifelong passion for writing code. My go-to is Python, but I've also used JavaScript and PHP a lot. In the past, I've created custom bespoke WordPress plugins and themes for clients, but what really excites me is solving problems using new ideas and emerging technologies.

I run a thriving Discord community, [Beginner.Codes](https://zech.codes/discord), where 13,000 members are helping each other become better programmers. I really enjoy breaking down complex concepts so that they are easier for everyone to understand. Check out my projects and join me on this exciting journey of exploring and building awesome stuff!

## Currently Working On

### Ommi

[Ommi](https://github.com/ZechCodes/Ommi) is an object model mapper framework for Python that aims for simplicity and portability over feature support. It relies on existing model implementations (tested with dataclasses, [Attrs](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/), and [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)) and includes drivers for SQLite3, PostgreSQL (psycopg 3.0), and MongoDB (motor).

To ensure compatibility with the most possible database backends, Ommi only aims to provide features that cover the most common use cases. It has an expressive query builder using Python's operators, relies on asyncio, and currently provides basic CRUD operations. Soon, it will provide support for joins and queries that reference multiple models.

## Active & Completed Projects

### Bevy

[Bevy](https://github.com/ZechCodes/Bevy) is a dependency inversion framework for Python. It relies on objects to track, however it doesn't require an understanding of OOP to use. It provides powerful control over how instances are created when injecting using a system of provider objects. Providers allow dependencies to be initialized with values from the environment, config files, etc. at runtime.

### Beginner.Codes

The [Beginner.Codes Organization](https://github.com/beginner-codes) I run has a bunch of projects I created that are necessary to  the operation of the Discord community. There are websites, Discord bots, etc., that I and the community members have written.

## Projects on the Backburner

### Schism

[Schism](https://github.com/ZechCodes/schism) allows you to write standalone services as if they were all part of the same application. This enables applications that can run either as a monolith or as distinct microservices. There is no build-time tooling; everything happens at runtime using dependency injection and facades that bridge calls to services.

### Wordlette

[Wordlette](https://github.com/ZechCodes/wordlette) is an opinionated and extensible CMS built as an out-of-the-box, no-code necessary, website solution.
